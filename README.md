# Phase-2-Cluster-Implementations

This is the complimentary code for the IEEE 2024 Paper Submission: "Dynamic Edge Clustering for Improved Communication Efficiency in the Internet of Vehicles." This code contains the Iterative K-Means Clustering model with three GNN approaches, GAT, GCN, and GraphSAGE, and compares it against a baseline approach with just K-Means. To use a specific GNN, you must modify the encoder to reflect these parameters.

Enjoy!
